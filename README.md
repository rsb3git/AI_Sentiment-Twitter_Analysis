# AI_Sentiment-Twitter_Analysis

Hi there! This analysis was part of a class I took in Yale on social media analytics. My group and I wrote the code for this analysis back in 2023 with barely any support from ChatGPT - crazy to even think about it today.

ChatGPT had just launched and we were wondering how, if at all, it has changed the public sentiment on AI. We thought people would view AI more favorably now... didn't turn out to be the case!
Of course, keep in mind, this was still the early days of ChatGPT... wonder what would happen if we ran the same analysis today...
